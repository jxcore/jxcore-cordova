## Sample JXcore cordova app for saving photos in sqlite db

![Android](./screens/android.png "Android")

Supposing you have already installed [JXcore](http://jxcore.com/downloads/), cordova and gulp globally, now install local npm modules:

```bash
jx install
```

To run on android just type:

```bash
gulp run-android
```

Note! Low ram devices (ram <= 512mb) **may** terminate app due to lack of memory.
